# Virtual Remote Lab - Light Diffraction Simulator

### DEMO

![DEMO](ScreenRecording2019-06-25at7.gif)

Final project for a CS class taken in Madrid, Spain. The professor also taught an optical physics course and wanted a way to allow his students to perform diffraction experiments without having to physically be in the lab. My partner and I created a virtual lab GUI that allowed users to input certain parameters and dynamically see a virtual output. To complete the project, we had to learn basic optical physics fundamentals, including how to calculate central line profiles for intensity patterns and wavelength minima/maxima locations.
